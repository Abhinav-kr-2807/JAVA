Part 1 - Implement the generic Shapes class as an interface s so that we can implement concrete classes like circle, triangle, rectangle class from it.


Part 2 - Refer the excel sheet for salary calculation. In this exercise, take an abstract class which is defined below and develop two classes. The abstract class represents the basic building block for employees in a personnel database. The code is shown below:

abstract class Employee
private String name, address;
protected int basicSalary;

The class contains three instance variables which hold the name, address and basic yearly salary of an employee.
